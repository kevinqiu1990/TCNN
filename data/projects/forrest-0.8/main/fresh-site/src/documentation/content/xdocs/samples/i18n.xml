      This sample will explain and demonstrate the i18n capabilities. Issue
      <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-707">FOR-707</a> has
      some discussion and doc links. We need to summarise it all into this demo.

      <title>Using the locale request parameter</title>
      <p>
        As a simple example of Forrest's i18n functionality, you can view
        <a href="site:i18n-demo">this demo page</a>. To see alternative language
        versions of this page, append the <code>locale</code> request parameter,
        e.g. <code>localhost:8888/samples/demo-i18n.html?locale=fr</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some other laguage demos (de, fr, nl).
      </p>
      <p>
        This only works in 'forrest run' mode. There are other ways to switch,
        this is just one way of demonstrating these features.
