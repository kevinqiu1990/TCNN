        Apache Forrest is a publishing framework that transforms input from
        various sources into a unified presentation in one or more output
        formats. The modular and extensible plugin architecture is based on
        Apache Cocoon and relevant standards, which separates presentation from
        content. Forrest can generate static documents, or be used as a dynamic
        server, or be deployed by its automated facility.
