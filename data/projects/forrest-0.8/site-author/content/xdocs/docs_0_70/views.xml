        Like stated in the <a href="site:v0.70//documentation/skins">Skin
        documentation file</a> the aim of the forrest skins is to provide many
        capabilities so that extra skins are not needed. Our experience showed
        that many forrest user had to create a new skin because the default skin
        did not offer the feature their wanted to use. That leaded us to develop
        a new concept of creating skins that would be easily extensible by a
        user.

      <p>
        The aim of the upcoming "forrest:views" skinning concept is to provide a
        flexible framework for creating site and page specific layout in
        different formats.

        The problem with the forrest skins so far has been that "only" the
        design changed (html-skeleton), but still we had to write a completely
        new skin and implement all functionality. Another problem was that the
        functionality was not easy extensible by a user. Then we decided to
        support the a standard regarding naming conventions for css elements.
        This standard has been developed on the
        <a href="http://www.oscom.org/events/oscom4/proposals/skins"> OSCOM
        website</a>, where you can find some more background informations.

        "A naming convention is an attempt to systematize names in a field so
        they unambiguously convey similar information in a similar manner."

      <p>
        That leaded to the development of the "leather-dev" skin which
        established a semantic container approach for div elements. The problems
        with leather-dev was pointed out on the mail
        <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=forrest-dev&nbsp;m=111049344517653&nbsp;w=2" >status
