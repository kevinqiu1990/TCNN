    <title>Using Catalog Entity Resolver for local DTDs</title>

      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
        This is a collection of notes for configuring the Catalog Entity
        Resolver with your favourite XML tools (validating parsers and editors).
      </p>
      <p>
        All XML documents declare their ruleset - the Document Type Definition
        (DTD). When Forrest processes the documents, it uses the Resolver to
        find Forrest's local copies of the DTDs, rather than trundling out onto
        the network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many Java-based XML tools already have an entity resolver, probably the
        same one that Forrest uses. Many non-Java tools also have an entity
        resolver. To use these tools with documents based on the Forrest DTDs,
        you need to configure the tools.
      </p>
      <note>
        The information provided here is not intended to endorse any particular
        tool.
      </note>
      <p>
        If you have any other configuration tips for a particular tool, then
        please send them to the forrest-dev mailing list.

      <title>General configuration notes</title>
      <p>
        The Forrest DTDs and supporting resources are in the Forrest
        distribution at <code>main/webapp/resources/schema/</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually all that is required is to direct your tool to the "catalog"
        supplied by Forrest at either:
        <code>$FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/resources/schema/catalog.xcat</code>
        (for XML Catalog) or
        <code>$FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/resources/schema/catalog</code> (for TR
        9401 Catalog).

      <title>Configuring specific tools</title>
      <section id="system">
        <title>Operating system catalog</title>
        <p>
          Some operating systems already provide a system-wide catalog that is
          used by many tools. This is usually located at
          <code>/etc/xml/catalog</code> or at
          <code>/usr/share/sgml/catalog</code> files.
        </p>
        <p>
          For an XML Catalog, add this line:
        </p>
        <source>
<![CDATA[
<nextCatalog
catalog="/usr/local/svn/forrest/main/webapp/resources/schema/catalog.xcat"/>
        ]]>
        </source>
        <p>
          For a TR 9401 Catalog, add this line:
        </p>
        <source>
<![CDATA[
CATALOG \
"/usr/local/svn/forrest/main/webapp/resources/schema/catalog"
        ]]>
        </source>
        <p>
          Actually you probably do not want to touch that system catalog, so
          rather create your own catalog file in your home directory which
          refers to both the Forrest catalog and your system catalog.

        <p>
          "xmllint" is part of the "libxml2" package. It is very fast and
          powerful, with are many facilities. It can validate whole directories
          of files at once. Set the SGML_CATALOG_FILES environment variable.
        </p>
        <source>
export SGML_CATALOG_FILES=$SGML_CATALOG_FILES:\
$FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/resources/schema/catalog
xmllint --valid --catalogs --noout mydoc.xml

          The following .vimrc entries are useful:

        <source>
au FileType xml set efm=%A%f:%l:\ %.%#error:\ %m,%-Z%p^,%-C%.%#
au FileType xml set makeprg=xmllint\ --noout\ --valid\ --catalogs\ %

        <p>
          "onsgmls" is part of the "Open SP" package. You need to also tell it
          where to find an "SGML declaration". The easiest way is to create your
          own little "my-catalog" file, containing this:
        </p>
        <source>
SGMLDECL "/usr/share/sgml/xml.dcl"
CATALOG \
"/usr/local/svn/forrest/main/webapp/resources/schema/catalog"
        </source>
        <p>
          Then point the parser at it:
        </p>
        <source>
onsgmls -c path/to/my-catalog -wall -wxml -s mydoc.xml
        </source>

        Forrest and Cocoon use the
        <link href="http://xml.apache.org/commons/components/resolver/">Catalog
        Entity Resolver</link> that is provided by the
        <link href="http://xml.apache.org/commons/">Apache XML Commons</link>
        project. The resolver is packaged with the Forrest distribution at
        <code>lib/core/xml-commons-resolver-x.y.jar</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Other Forrest documentation has some notes about configuring the entity
        resolver for your own DTDs. See <link href="site:validation">XML
        Validation</link>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cocoon has extensive documentation about the entity resolver. See
