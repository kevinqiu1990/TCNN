    <faq id="docs">
      <question>Where is all of the documentation?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          You have a local copy of the main documentation with your version of
          Forrest. Do 'cd site-author; forrest run' and visit
          http://localhost:8888/ in your browser. The most recent documentation
          is in SVN trunk which creates the forrest.apache.org website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each <link href="site:plugins/index">plugin</link> has its own
          documentation and working examples of its techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          The example seed site has other documentation and working examples of
          various techniques. Do 'cd my-new-directory; forrest seed-sample;
          forrest run'. Every hour the forrestbot generates a static version of
          this documentation on our <link href="site:zone">testing zone</link>.

    <faq id="requirements">
      <question> What are the system requirements for Forrest? </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Forrest includes everything necessary to build and run, except of
          course for Java. In addition to all the Cocoon JARs, Forrest includes
          and uses its own version of Apache Ant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Java 1.4 (or newer) is required. If you are only going to use Forrest
          as-is then you need only the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). If you
          intend to enhance and rebuild Forrest (or use the Forrest sources with
          Subversion or use a source snapshot) then you need the full JDK.

    <faq id="older-plugins">
      <question> How to use older versions of specific plugins? </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Sometimes one does not want to use the most recent functionality of a
          plugin and instead need to use an older version. Information about
          changes to each plugin can be found in its
          <link href="site:plugins/index">documentation</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the forrest.properties file, specify the version of the plugin that
          you require, e.g.
        </p>
        <source>project.required.plugins=org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.PhotoGallery-0.1,...</source>
        <p>
          Users of Forrest-0.7 will need to do this for the projectInfo plugin
          if you get the following error ...
        </p>
        <source>Could not find component for role:
 [org.apache.cocoon.components.modules.input.InputModule/lm]
 (Key='org.apache.cocoon.components.modules.input.InputModule/</source>
        <p>
          ... then sorry, we mistakenly added new "locationmap" functionality
          (due in version 0.8). So do this ...
        </p>
        <source>project.required.plugins=org.apache.forrest.plugin.input.projectInfo-0.1,...</source>
      </answer>
    </faq>
    <faq id="single-document">
      <question> What is the best way to generate "standalone documents" using Forrest? </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          There is a trick that can cut down your turnaround time with building.
          In forrest.properties ...
        </p>
        <source>
# The URL to start crawling from
#project.start-uri=linkmap.html
        </source>
        <p>
          Uncomment that and set it to the specific page that you want. Forrest
          will build that single document, then of course it will keep crawling
          links from there. It might be confined to a sub-directory, but
          depending on links could end up generating the whole site. The main
          thing is that your page of interest is built first.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is probably easiest to make this change temporarily as a
          command-line parameter, e.g.
        </p>
        <source>
forrest -Dproject.start-uri=live-sites.html
        </source>
        <p>
          You can terminate forrest with 'kill' or Ctrl-C after it has built
          your pages of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cocoon can be instructed via the <link href="#cli-xconf">Cocoon
          cli.xconf</link> file to not follow links (see its "follow-links"
          parameter). So this will build only the document that was specified.
          Be careful, if you also usually build PDF pages, then they will not be
          built.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cocoon can also be instructed to not process certain URIs if you need
          to temporarily exclude then.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another useful technique is to use 'wget' or Apache Ant's Get task to
          retrieve individual files, e.g. Do 'forrest run' and then 'wget
          http://localhost:8888/index.pdf'.

    <faq id="maxmemory">
      <question> How can I specify the amount of memory to be used by Java? </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          There are two ways to control this. If you get an OutOfMemoryError
          when Cocoon is generating pages, see the first paragraph. If you get
          an OutOfMemoryError when outside of Cocoon (e.g., copying raw files),
          see the second paragraph.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>maxmemory</code> property in the
          <code>forrest.properties</code> file controls how much memory Cocoon
          uses. Like many other properties you can copy them from the default
          configuration at <code>main/fresh-site/forrest.properties</code>
        </p>
        <p>
          Set the <code>ANT_OPTS</code> environment variable before you run
          forrest. The exact value you set it to is dependant on your JVM, but
          something like <code>ANT_OPTS=-Xmx500M</code> will probably work.

    <faq id="debug">
      <question> How can I start forrest in Java debug mode? </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The <code>forrest.jvmargs</code> property in the
          <code>forrest.properties</code> file can be used to start forrest in
          debug mode on a specific port. <code>forrest.jvmargs=-Xdebug
          -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n</code>

    <faq id="edit-content">
      <question>What tools can be used to edit the content?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          If you are using the Apache Forrest XML
          <link href="site:dtd-docs">document format</link> or DocBook or other
          XML document types, then you can use any text editor or even a
          dedicated XML editor. You must ensure valid XML. See our
          <link href="site:catalog"
            >configuration notes</link> for
          various editors.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are content management systems like
          <link href="ext:lenya">Apache Lenya</link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that Forrest can also use other source formats, such as
          OpenOffice.org docs or JSPWiki. Use the appropriate editor for those
          document types and ensure that the document stucture is consistent.
          Forrest can also use "html" as the source format, in which case you
          can use text editors or "html editors" such as the one provided with
          the Mozilla web browser.

        How to use the <code>site.xml</code> configuration file for menus and linking.
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The <code>site.xml</code> configuration file is used for two different
          purposes: defining the navigation menus, and as a method for defining
          references to be used when linking between documents. This file is

      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          There are examples in the 'forrest seed site' and also the Forrest

    <faq id="crawler">
      <question>
        Help, one of my documents is not being rendered.
      </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Did you make a link to it? Forrest does not find documents by scanning
          the filesystem to find the source documents. Rather it starts at one
          document and crawls the links to find other documents to process.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are essentially two ways to create links. Via a site.xml file to
          define the navigation and menu structure, or via direct relative
          linking. See the to previous FAQs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally the source material will be local. The Forrest crawler does
          not follow and process off-site links. The new locationmap (0.8+)
          enables content to be drawn from remote sources.

    <faq id="PDF-output">
      <question>How can I generate one pdf-file out of the whole site or selected pages of the site?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Add the following entries to your site.xml file:
        </p>
        <source>
<![CDATA[
  <about tab="home" label="About" href="">
 	  ...
    <all_site label="Full HTML" href="wholesite.html"/>    
    <all_sitePDF label="Full PDF" href="wholesite.pdf"/>  
     ...
  </about>]]>
        </source>
        <p>
          In this case the menu labeled "About" will have 2 new items: "Full
          PDF" and "Full HTML". (See also <link href="site:pdf-tab">How to
          create a PDF document for each tab</link>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          This assumes that you use the
          <link href="site:linking">site.xml</link> method for your site
          structure and navigation, rather than the old book.xml method.

    <faq id="pageBreaks">
      <question>How do I insert page breaks into documents?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Page breaks do not make a great deal of sense in HTML documents
          intended for display on a screen. However, PDF documents are intended
          for printing and therefore page breaks can be important.
        </p>
        <p>
          To insert a page break in a PDF document simply add
          <em>pageBreakBefore</em> and/or <em>pageBreakAfter</em> to the class
          attribute of the block you wish to force a page break on. All the
          common block grouping elements support this class, for example, note,
          warning, p and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want these classes to be processed in your HTML documents as
          well you should add the following to the <code>extra-css</code>
          element in your projects <code>skinconf.xml</code>
        </p>
        <source> 
          .pageBreakBefore { 
            margin-bottom: 0; 
            page-break-before: always; 
          } 
          .pageBreakAfter {
            margin-bottom: 0;

        <p>
          Forrest uses <link href="http://xml.apache.org/fop/">Apache FOP</link>
          for rendering PDFs. FOP cannot handle all image types natively, and
          requires third-party jars to be added. FOP natively handles BMP, GIF,
          JPG, TIFF and EPS (with a few limitations). FOP can also handle SVG
          (via Batik!and PNG (see below). For details, see

          In <code>tabs.xml</code>, use @href instead of @dir, and omit the
          trailing '/'. Which file to serve is then a concern of the sitemap.
          For example, if the "User Manual" tab should link to

      <question> How can I use a start-up-page other than index.html? </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Forrest by default assumes that the first page (home page) of your
          site is named index.html. Which is good because most web servers are
          configured to look for index.html when you call a url like
          http://myserver
        </p>
        <p>
          Like most settings in Forrest however this can be changed, for example
          when you want your start-up-page for a CD-based documentation project
          to be named 'start.html'.
        </p>

    <faq id="encoding">
      <question>Does Forrest handle accents for non-English languages?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Yes, Forrest can process text in any language, so you can include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>accents: á é í ó ú</li>
          <li>diereses: ä ë ï ö ü</li>
          <li>tildes: ã ñ ĩ õ ũ</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This is because sources for Forrest docs are XML documents, which can
          include any of these, provided the encoding declared by the XML doc
          matches the actual encoding used in the file. For example if you
          declare the default encoding:
        </p>
        <source>
<![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>]]>
        </source>
        <p>
          but the file content is actually using ISO-8859-1 then you will
          receive validation errors, especially if you include some non-ASCII
          characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          This situation is commonly encountered when you edit the templates
          created by <code>forrest seed</code> with your favorite (probably
          localized) editor without paying attention to the encoding, or when
          you create a new file and simply copy the headers from another file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although UTF-8 is an encoding well-suited for most languages, it is
          not usually the default in popular editors or systems. In UNIX-like
          systems, most popular editors can handle different encodings to write
          the file in disk. With some editors the encoding of the file is
          preserved, while with others the default is used regardless of the
          original encoding. In most cases the encoding used to write files can
          be controlled by setting the environment variable <code>LANG</code> to
          an appropriate value, for instance:
        </p>
        <source>[localhost]$ export LANG=en_US.UTF-8</source>
        <p>
          Of course the <em>appropriate</em> way to set the encoding depends on
          the editor/OS, but ultimately relys on the user preferences. So you
          can use the encoding you prefer, as long as the <code>encoding</code>
          attribute of the XML declaration matches the actual encoding of the
          file. This means that if you are not willing to abandon ISO-8859-1 you
          can always use the following declaration instead:
        </p>
        <source>
<![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>]]>
        </source>
        <p>
          Another option is to use "character entities" such as <code>
<![CDATA[&ouml;]]>
          </code> (&ouml;) or the numeric form <code>
<![CDATA[&#246;]]>
          </code> (&#246;).
        </p>
        <p>
          Another related issue is that your webserver needs to send http
          headers with the matching charset definitions to the html page.

      <answer>
        <p>
          By default Forrest does not clean its build directories in the project
          workspaces. This enables Cocoon to use its disk cache to speed up
          successive runs of forrest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing 'forrest clean-site' will remove the contents of the project's
          generated documents directory. Doing 'forrest clean-work' will remove
          the project's work directories (usually build/tmp and build/webapp
          which include the Cocoon cache and the Cocoon logs). Doing 'forrest

        <p>
          Because we are based on Apache Cocoon, a lot of the functionality is
          provided behind-the-scenes, i.e. we use Cocoon's sitemaps and sitemap
          components such as XSLT transformers. So there is not much need for
          Java code in Forrest.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Forrest developers who want to explore or enhance that code, see

          packaged version of Cocoon and so can include your contributions.

          That said, you will find some Java code in Forrest at main/java/...

    <faq id="populate-cache">
      <question>How to enhance the responsiveness of the cache?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Apache Cocoon has a sophisticated cache. When running Forrest in
          dynamic mode, the initial visitor will receive slower response. The
          very first page served will cause Cocoon to cache the pipelines. Later
          requests will re-use those cached components and add others to the
          cache. A good technique is to warm up the cache after the forrest
          webapp has been re-started. Requesting the front page alone will
          populate the cache with the common items used for other pages. Using a
          spider such as wget, will warm up everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Cocoon cache and sitemaps can be tuned. See
          <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/performancetips.html">Cocoon
          Performance Tips</link> and

          Responsiveness can be further enhanced by utilising a transparent

        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          This means creating a directory <code>src/documentation/conf</code>
          (or wherever <code>${forrest.conf-dir}</code> points) and copying
          <code>$FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/WEB-INF/cli.xconf</code> to it.
          Declare the location of this file in the forrest.properties
          configuration, e.g.

        </p>
        <p>
          Then edit cli.xconf, and add any exclude sections that you require.
          The default cli.xconf ignores directory links and links containing

        <p>
          In a 'forrest seed site' the project and the group logo are generated

          Perhaps you want to change the colours too. Edit the file at
          <code>src/documentation/content/xdocs/images/project.svg</code> and

      <answer>
        <p>
          First consider whether your needs would be better met by Cocoon
          itself, rather than Forrest.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, there are valid reasons for wanting programmatically
          generated content, so here is how to enable XSP:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Download <link
              href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/cocoon/trunk/lib/optional/"
              >jdtcore-*.jar</link> from Cocoons SVN tree, and copy it to the $FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/WEB-INF/lib
            directory (or lib/core/ directory in the source distribution).</li>
          <li><p>
              Add the following generator definition in the map:generators

            </source></li>
          <li><p>
              Decide how you want to use XSP. For single files, you could just
              define a *.xml matcher:
            </p>

</map:match>]]>
            </source>
            <p>
              You may instead wish to override forrest.xmap to define a general
              mapping for XSPs.

          Breadcrumbs begin with up to three URLs specified in

        <p>
          If any links are blank, they are not used. After these first links,
          JavaScript looks at the URL for the current page and makes a link for
          each directory after the domain. If you are viewing the site locally,
          there is no domain and so there will be no extra breadcrumbs, only the

    <faq id="checksums">
      <question>How do I enable Cocoon's document checksum feature?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Why might you want to do this? There is really no effect on Cocoon
          processing, but a little time can be saved on filesystem writes, which
          will accumulate to a big savings for a site with thousands of files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some tools depend on the "date-last-modified" timestamp of the
          generated files. For example, the Forrestbot will then deploy only the
          modified files.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was some discussion about this on the Forrest developer mailing
          list:
          <link href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=forrest-dev&amp;s=cocoon+checksum">Cocoon
          Checksum</link> Specifically note that this feature only stops Cocoon
          from writing to disk if the new file is the same as the existing file.
          Cocoon still spends the same amount of time generating the content as
          it would if checksums were not enabled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Locate the <code>checksums-uri</code> tag within cli.xconf and replace
          the contents with an absolute path and filename for the checksums
          file. Projects can supply their own (see FAQ:
          <link href="#cli-xconf">Cocoon cli.xconf</link>) or use the default
          installation-wide cli.xconf file.

        <p>
          One &s; file in your project root can replace all the book.xml files
          (one per directory) in your site. Internally, Forrest uses &s; to
          dynamically generate book.xml files. However, Forrest first checks for
          the existence of a book.xml file, so backwards-compatibility is
          preserved. If a directory has a book.xml file, the book.xml will be
          used to generate the menu. This supplement is useful in situations
          where &s;-generated menus aren't appropriate. See

    <faq id="docbook">
      <question> How do I use DocBook as the XML documentation format? </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          There are two ways. Forrest has a <code>simplifiedDocbook</code>
          plugin which can transform the DocBook format into the Forrest "xdocs"
          format on-the-fly and then render that as normal Forrest documents. Be
          aware that the stylesheet that does this transformation is
          deliberately very limited and does not attempt to deal with all
          DocBook elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other way is to use the full DocBook stylesheets directly. The
          DocBook DTDs are shipped with Forrest and automatically handled.
          However, you will need to have the DocBook stylesheets on your system
          (they are too massive to ship with Forrest) and configure Forrest
          accordingly. You will need to create a
          <link href="site:project-sitemap">project sitemap</link> as explained
          in <link href="site:your-project">Using Forrest</link> and add matches
          to handle your DocBook documents. Here is an example. Note that you
          need to change it to suit your situation. The match must be very
          specific so that only the DocBook documents are matched. The rest of
          the documents will be handled by Forrest core. Powerful regex
          capabilities are available.

        <p>
          You need to define the xhtml serializer used in &lt;map:serialize

          <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/serializers/xhtml-serializer.html">Cocoon
          docs</link> for the elements you need to add to define this component.
          You can see examples of other components being added in the
          <code>FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/sitemap.xmap</code> file. Alternatively
          use the "html" DocBook stylesheets and the default Cocoon serializer,
          i.e. &lt;map:serialize type="html"/&gt;
        </p>
        <p>
          The output of the above sitemap will be plain html not adorned with a
          Forrest theme and navigation. If instead you need the latter, then use
          the following technique instead. This transforms DocBook xml to html,
          then uses a Forrest core stylesheet to transform and serialize to the
          internal xml format, then the normal machinery takes over and does the
          output transformation. This use the Content Aware Pipelines
          (<link href="site:cap">SourceTypeAction</link>) to peek at the source
          xml. If it is DocBook-4.2 then this sitemap match is triggered, if not
          then it falls through to the core of Forrest.

          You can also use a mixture of the methods, some handled automatically

          Join one of the Forrest project <link href="site:mail-lists">mailing
          lists</link> and tell us what you would like to see improved. We
          regard all feedback as valuable, particularly from
          newcomers&mdash;often, close proximity blinds software developers to
          faults that are obvious to everyone else. Don't be shy!

      <question> How can job positions be advertised? </question>
      <answer>
        <p>
          Employers can send notices about employment opportunities. There is a
          special jobs&lt;AT&gt;apache.org mailing list. You can also send these
          notices to the project mailing lists, e.g. dev list at Forrest or
          Cocoon (add [jobs] to the subject line). You can also approach
          particular developers off-list. However only genuine jobs, not pleas
          for free support (see <link href="site:mail-lists">mailing
          lists</link>).
        </p>

          Some enlightened employers enable their employees to contribute
          material which was created during work time using work-related
          resources. Please note the need to file a Corporate Contributor
