    <title>Generate an ASF mirrors page using interactive web form</title>
    <abstract>
      Include html form elements into a forrest-generated html page. For
      example, this enables building automated download mirror pages for ASF
      project websites.

  <audience title="Intended Audience">
    <ul>
      <li>Any Apache project that uses Forrest to generate their website
        will need to have a mirrors page.</li>
      <li>Also anyone interested in the use of embedding html form
        elements into a generated Forrest page.</li>
    </ul>
  </audience>
  <purpose title="Purpose">
    <p>
      All Apache projects use dynamically generated download pages which
      determine the closest mirror and provide an interactive list of the
      current alternative mirrors. This HowTo describes the procedure to
      generate the template page that is utilised by the mirrors.cgi script.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mirrors.cgi and mirrors.html are "extra" documents, i.e. have no links
      from anywhere in the site. So we explain how to process additional files.
    </p>
  </purpose>
  <prerequisites title="Prerequisites">
    <ul>
      <li>Followed the documentation about
      <link href="http://www.apache.org/~bodewig/mirror.html">Making your
      downloads mirrorable</link> and
      <link href="http://www.apache.org/dev/mirrors.html">Apache Mirroring Information</link>
      .
      </li>
      <li>Established your ASF distribution space as described.</li>
      <li>Already building your project website with Forrest.</li>
    </ul>
  </prerequisites>
  <steps title="Steps">
    <section id="cgi">
      <title>Add the mirrors.cgi as a raw file</title>
      <p>
        As explained in the mirrors document, there will be a two-line CGI
        wrapper script at the top-level of your website called
        <code>mirrors.cgi</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Utilising the Forrest concept of raw un-processed content, add the file
        as <code>src/documentation/mirrors.cgi</code> (copy the Forrest
        project's
        <link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk/site-author/content/mirrors.cgi">mirrors.cgi</link>)
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="html">
      <title>Add the mirrors.html to xdocs directory</title>
      <p>
        This file contains the html content of your mirror page, including the
        html form elements which drive the mirror selection. It also contains
        the specific tokens that are interpreted by the mirrors.cgi script to
        add the list of mirrors and select the closest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add the file as <code>src/documentation/xdocs/mirrors.html</code> (Use
        the Forrest project's
        <link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk/site-author/content/xdocs/mirrors.html">mirrors.html</link>
        as a template and edit it to suit.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the special tokens (e.g. [if-any http] [for http]) need to be
        encompassed by xml comments.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="menu">
      <title>Add a menu entry for Download</title>
      <p>
        Add an entry to your site.xml navigation. For example ...
      </p>
      <source>
<![CDATA[
 <about label="About">
  <index label="Index" href="index.html"/>
  <license label="License" href="license.html"/>
  <download label="Download" href="http://forrest.apache.org/mirrors.cgi"/>
  <download_html href="mirrors.html"/><!-- so the page is part of a tab -->
  ...]]>
      </source>
    </section>
    <section id="link">
      <title>Cause the mirrors.html to be processed as an extra file</title>
      <p>
        Forrest gathers the links that are to be crawled, by reading site.xml
        and by finding any other internal links in the actual documents. There
        is no link to mirrors.html because it is an extra file that needs to be
        generated and skinned, but not linked in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cocoon command-line interface
        (<link href="http://cocoon.apache.org/2.1/userdocs/offline/">CLI</link>)
        to the rescue. Add an entry to your project's cli.xconf by copying the
        default one from
        <code>$FORREST_HOME/main/webapp/WEB-INF/cli.xconf</code> to your
        <code>src/documentation/conf/</code> directory (or wherever
        ${forrest.conf-dir} points). Add the following entry ...
      </p>
      <source>
<![CDATA[
<uris name="mirrors" follow-links="false">
  <uri type="append" src="mirrors.html"/>
</uris>]]>
      </source>
    </section>
    <section id="forrest">
      <title>Run 'forrest' to build your site</title>
      <p>
        That is all that you need to do, Forrest will take care of it from
        there. Run the '<code>forrest</code>' command. The mirrors.html page
        will be generated with the skin applied.
      </p>
      <note>
        Due to Issue
        <link href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOR-480">FOR-480</link>,
        the generated mirror.html will end up in forrest/main/site/mirrors.html
        rather than in the project's build directory.
