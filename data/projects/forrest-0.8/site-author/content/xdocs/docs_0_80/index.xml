      A good place to get started in our docs is the

    </p>
    <p>
      In the <a href="howto/index.html">How-To</a> section you will find various
      practical guides on how to achieve common objectives in Forrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also have a <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> list that you should consult
      before posting questions to our user list.
    </p>
    <p>
      The documentation <a href="site:linkmap">Table of Contents</a> provides a
      useful overview of the main documentation. <a href="site:faq/docs">This
      FAQ</a> explains that there is other documentation at the example forrest
      seed site and that each plugin has its own documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are docs for <a href="site:versions/overview">other versions</a>
      too.
