      <p>
        Forrest supplies a collection of default skins which are configurable
        and so should meet the needs of most projects. The aim is to provide
        many capabilities so that extra skins are not needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the new Dispatcher capability will be a better solution. See
        <a href="site:status-themes">Status of Themes: Skins and Dispatcher</a>.

      <title>Convention for choosing skin names</title>
      <p>
        The skin names are based on playing with the word "skin". See our
        technique for
        <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/forrest/trunk/main/webapp/skins/new-skin-names.txt">choosing
        skin names</a>. A name with "-dev" extension signifies that it is under
        development. There is no concept of versions of default skins. New skins
        have new names.

          Uses CSS "div" and no HTML tables.

          This skin is based on version 1.1 of the
          <a href="http://style.tigris.org/">style.tigris.org</a> project. (It
          deliberately contravenes our skin naming convention.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Examples: <a href="http://www.core.gen.tr/">Core Computer Security
          Group</a>

          This is a very minimal skin to produce plain HTML documents. Such
          capability might be useful to generate a collection of documents for
          some off-line product's user help system.
        </p>

        The following skins are retained for a little while longer, but are
        deprecated, so please move to one of the other skins.

          This is the old skin that we have been dragging around since early
          days. Uses HTML tables.
