      This doc is under development. It should have general notes to assist all
      developers to use the latest code in Forrest SVN and tips for working with
      SVN. An extra section would have other tips specific for Forrest
      committers. Some tips should instead be added to the ASF-wide docs, where
      we can link to them.

      <title>Golden Rules</title>
      <p>
        Using subversion seems so easy. But there are so many things you can do
        to mess up other peoples work. This document tries to name just a few:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be familiar with the <a href="site:version-control">instructions</a> for using Forrest SVN.
        </li>
        <li>See ASF-wide notes for <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/#svn">developers</a>.
        </li>
        <li><a href="contrib.html#svn-config">Configure</a> your svn client.
          <fixme author="">
            Move the notes from contrib.html to here. See other notes in
            <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=114834506800002">email</a>.
          </fixme></li>
        <li>When moving an existing file  please use "svn move fromFile toFile". This ensures 
             that the history of the item is not lost.</li>
      </ul>
