<!-- The rules for tabs are:
    @dir will always have '/@indexfile' added.
    @indexfile gets appended to @dir if the tab is selected. Defaults to 'index.html'
    @href is not modified unless it is root-relative and obviously specifies a
    directory (ends in '/'), in which case /index.html will be added
    If @id's are present, site.xml entries with a matching @tab will be in that tab.

   Tabs can be embedded to a depth of two. The second level of tabs will only 
    be displayed when their parent tab is selected.
