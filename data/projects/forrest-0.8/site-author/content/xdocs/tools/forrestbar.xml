      <title>Installing the ForrestBar</title>
      <p>
        ForrestBar is currently compatible with Firefox 0.9 - 1.5+ and Mozilla
        1.x browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Select this link to <link href="forrestbar.xpi">install</link>
        ForrestBar.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the extension does not automatically install for you when clicking on
        the link, download ForrestBar by right clicking on the link and select
        Save As... to save the file to your computer. To install, simply drag
        the downloaded .xpi file into your browser's window and drop it.
      </p>
      <p>
        To build ForrestBar locally rather than downloading, go to
        FORREST_HOME/tools/forrestbar and run the following command:
        <code>forrest -f build.xml</code> and the .xpi file will be built for
        you in the FORREST_HOME/tools/forrestbar/build directory. You can then
        install it by dragging and dropping as indicated above.
