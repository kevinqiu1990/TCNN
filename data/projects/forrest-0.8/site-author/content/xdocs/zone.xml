      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>
        The server <a href="ext:forrest-zone">forrest.zones.apache.org</a>
        provides our testing and demonstration area. It is managed by Apache
        Forrest committers. The material is intended for developer use only.

      <title>Configuration</title>
      <p>
        Configuration files and directory structures are stored in SVN at

directories /forrestbot-*/ are the forrestbot homes, see below.
setenv*.sh ... these are sourced by the forrestbots and other
  cronjobs and user configs, to set the environment.

      <p>
        <strong>test-sources</strong>
      </p>
      <source>
A place to hold sources for various test sites.
Normally these would be in the relevant project's SVN.
Hold them here until building properly.
</source>
      <p>
        All files are owned in the group "other" so any one of us can
        edit/update. Make sure that your 'umask' is set properly so that new
        files have group write permissions. See the
        <a href="#admin-user">notes</a> about user administration. FIXME: Add a
        proper group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cron runs the various Forrestbots and management tasks, such as updating
        the forrest-trunk software; cleaning up old logfiles, etc. FIXME: These
        are not yet managed under SVN, see ~crossley/my-crontab.txt

      <title>The forrestbots</title>
      <p>
        There are various forrestbots operating with different versions of
        forrest. Their home is at $CONFIG
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>$CONFIG/forrestbot-trunk</strong>
      </p>
      <source>
forrestbot operating with trunk.
builds various sites automatically, triggered via cron.
Configuration files and the generated results are at $DOC_ROOT/ft/
FIXME: The web interface is coming soon.
</source>
      <p>
        <strong>$CONFIG/forrestbot-trunk-stable</strong>
      </p>
      <source>
forrestbot operating with trunk-stable.
builds various sites, only runs when needed, triggered via cron.
Configuration files and the generated results are at $DOC_ROOT/fts/
</source>
      <p>
        Forrestbot logs are at $CONFIG/forrestbot-trunk*/logs/ and old ones are
        cleaned up by the crontab. There is also a log file for each site that
        forrestbot builds which captures the output of cron (cronout-*.txt). Be
        sure to verify this logfile after making configuration changes.

      <title>Administration</title>

        See the general notes for the
        <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/solaris-zones.html">zone
        administration</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project chair is the root user. Committers can ask on the dev list
        to get a user account added or modified.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow Leo's config ideas at
        <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/gump/GumpZonesConfig">GumpZonesConfig</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also keep an occasional eye on $CONFIG/update-forrest-trunk.log This is
        the output of the cronjob to do svn update to trunk and re-build.
      </p>
      <p>
        FIXME: Start apache2 on boot (using new Solaris init.d replacement
        called smf). At the moment we need to realise that it is down and
        manually restart as per http://www.apache.org/dev/solaris-zones.html
        Also it seems that /var/run/apache2 is wiped out on reboot, so need to
        mkdir again.
      </p>

sudo mkdir /var/run/apache2
sudo /usr/apache2/bin/apachectl -k start

        <p>
          Look at the setup of some other users on our zone.
